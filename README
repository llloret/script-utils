Very basic README file

for now, it just shows the scripts with a brief explanation of what it does
- find_big_files.sh
  Very simple shell script to show big files in a given directory

  Possible enhancements: choose recursive or non-recursive, accept file patterns to include / exclude, accept args with names (instead of positional)
